Input for AI to ingest and use to enhance “Our Story” 


WHAT are the emergencies we/you are concerned about?
•	In considering how to prepare for emergencies, our team took an analytical and pragmatic approach.  We started with WHAT are the emergencies in which we want to solve for; knowing many factors could lead to any one of them and possibly two or more emergency scenarios could occur at once or be triggered by another.”
•	E.g. – EMP, Civil Unrest, Natural Disasters, CBRN, Infrastructure / Cyber Attack, Monetary Collapse
We then identified the key categories which an emergency could impact.  Understanding that missing any one of them could create a cascade of additional issues, jeopardizing your safety and ultimately even survival. 
•	We realized you could separate and or combine several of these categories. Based on our research, we found this organization provided the best overall approach. 
•	E.g. – shelter, food, water, protection, medical, clothing, tools, fuel, knowledge, etc
Our next step was to determine WHEN (aka – the timeframe) each segment would be impacted by each scenario.  We recognized many scenarios could have multiple timeframes to be solved for to prevent life threatening problems. 
•	For example, in any scenario where there is an extended loss of power, the public water sources (water to your home) will be impacted.  Most water towers have ~ 1 day of water stored in them for the communities they serve.  So, after one day, the water which is cleaned at the water treatment plant and then pumped up into the water tower will only last as long as the backup generators have fuel.  In most cases, this is 3 days. So, water will be available for ~ 3 days, then the secondary problem of no water to your home’s tap and toilets will be occur.  This will cause a multitude of cascading life-threatening problems, e.g. – safe drinking water, how to clean dishes, flushing toilets, etc.  These problems lead to dehydration, a lack of sanitary conditions and infection.  
By combining WHAT are the threats, the KEY CATEGORIES for health/wellness/survival and understanding the WHEN of the challenges would occur, we could then begin to methodically solve for them.  We also realized the severity of the threat which occurred would also impact what a solution would be.  So, we broke out our solutions to address 1 week, 1 month, 1 year and greater than a year timeframes 
•	For example, continuing with the water scenario of the preceding section, after 3 days, you would need to use stored water, having a minimum of a week and best to have a month.  During that timeframe, unless water was going to be restored, you would need to begin to collect water (rain, stream, lake) and purify it.   
Applying the approach described above, we bought, tried and tested products to solve for the problems our families would face in emergencies. 
•	When then shared our list of all solutions with family and friends.  Everyone had concerns and had been thinking they wanted to do something.  After seeing our list, they were overwhelmed, saying “I don’t know where to start” and or “If I only have $xx to spend, what should I get?”  
•	Hearing that feedback, we began curating our list into bundles.  We designed the bundles to solve for the most likely problems based on both timeframe and cost. 
•	For example, our first bundle is designed to cover many of the scenarios for up to 1 week.  From there, as the bundles increase in cost, they provide solutions for a longer timeframe (e.g. - 1 month, 1 year, beyond) and offer greater coverage of the identified problems.  
•	Basically, we applied our research to determine what’s the most critical items to have to give you the most coverage at different price points.
•	We also offer the ability for you to add on to the bundle to cover additional people or items which solve a specific issue; e.g. – quality gas masks and replacement filters for CBRN threats (~ $500 per person).  
•	Thus allowing you to configure a bundle to address your scenario concerns and family.
What’s included
•	The cost of the bundle includes the cost of the items, taxes and shipping to your location.
•	We also state the general actions you will need to do once you receive the items; e.g. – fill up the water storage containers from your home tap.
•	Information sheet(s) regarding key items in your bundle which may not be apparent or key learnings we found in testing/using them ourselves. 
•	Virtual consultation, if included in the bundle, or selected as an add-on. 
What’s not included
•	We do offer LIMITED customizations, substitutions, color selections, quantity changes, etc. Why?  The items are specifically curated based on our research, best practices and to remediate the challenges you face.  Further, the items are not based on fashion or taste, but for the ability to give you and your family solutions. 
Our sources:
•	We read and studied numerous leading books, guides, lists; 
•	We conferred with city, state and federal emergency leaders; and 
•	We discussed our approach and solutions with law enforcement, military and three letter agency veterans.  
•	All of which provided insights, ideas and nuances which we applied. 
What’s unique:
•	First, we were trying to solve for how to prepare, provide and protect our OWN families.
•	Second, we have tried and/or tested all of the solutions we are recommending.  
•	Third, we offer actual solutions you can purchase, the same ones we have implemented for our OWN families.

Need to add in we used Tiran’s unique advance IT expertise to then leverage AI to enhance our foundation.
