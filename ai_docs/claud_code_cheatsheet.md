Claude Code Cheat Sheet
=======================

A comprehensive guide to setting up and using Claude Code efficiently with a keyboard-first workflow.

* * * * *

0\. First Time Setup: Login
---------------------------

IMPORTANT: Before anything else, make sure you're logged in correctly to get the best experience.

### Login Instructions:

1.  Open Claude Code in your terminal
2.  You'll be prompted to log in
3.  Choose the authentication method attached to your Claude subscription plan (not API)
    -   If you have Claude Pro or Claude Max, use your Anthropic account login
    -   This ensures you get the full benefits of your subscription plan
4.  Verify you're logged in by running `/cost` - you should see your subscription info

Why This Matters: Logging in with your subscription plan (vs API) gives you better rate limits, access to the latest models, and no per-request costs if you have Claude Max.

1\. Claude Code Setup
---------------------

Configure Claude Code for an optimal development experience. Follow these setup steps in order.

### Step 1: Shift+Enter Support (Essential First Step)

The most important setup - enables submitting messages to Claude with `SHIFT + ENTER`.

Setup Instructions:

Run `/terminal-setup` in Claude Code, which will automatically configure your terminal settings.

Manual Setup Alternative:

1.  Open Cursor/VS Code settings
2.  Search for "Terminal > Integrated: Send Keybindings To Shell"
3.  Uncheck this option

Fallback: If Shift+Enter isn't working, use `\ + ENTER` (backslash + enter) to submit messages.

Why This Matters: Keeps your hands on the keyboard for faster iterations with Claude.

### Step 2: Settings Customization

Customize Claude Code behavior through `.claude/settings.json` in your project root.

Common Settings:

`{  "model":  "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",  "autoApprovalSettings":  {  "enabled":  true,  "patterns":  [  "Read(//Users/yourname/**)",  "Bash(npm run lint)",  "Bash(git log:*)"  ]  },  "statusLine":  {  "enabled":  true,  "template":  "{{model}} | {{tokens}}"  }  }`

Key Settings to Know:

-   `model`: Choose which Claude model to use
-   `autoApprovalSettings`: Auto-approve specific tool uses to speed up workflow
-   `statusLine`: Show model and token usage in status bar
-   `hooks`: Configure shell commands that run on events (see Step 4)

### Step 3: MCP Server Configuration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude Code with specialized capabilities.

What MCP Servers Provide:

-   Supabase: Database operations, migrations, logs
-   Context7: Up-to-date library documentation
-   Time: Timezone conversions and current time
-   Custom servers: Build your own integrations

Setup via .mcp.json:

`{  "mcpServers":  {  "supabase":  {  "command":  "npx",  "args":  ["-y",  "@supabase/mcp-server"]  },  "context7":  {  "command":  "npx",  "args":  ["-y",  "@context7/mcp-server"]  }  }  }`

When to Use:

-   Working with databases → Supabase MCP
-   Need latest library docs → Context7 MCP
-   Custom workflows → Build your own MCP server

### Step 4: Hooks Configuration

Hooks run shell commands automatically in response to events.

Common Hook: Noise When Claude Finishes

Play a sound when Claude finishes responding (great for audio feedback).

`{  "hooks":  {  "Stop":  [  {  "hooks":  [  {  "type":  "command",  "command":  "afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff"  }  ]  }  ]  }  }`

Available Hooks:

-   `UserPromptSubmit`: Runs when you submit a message
-   `Stop`: Runs when Claude stops/finishes responding
-   `PreToolUse`: Runs before tool execution (with optional matcher)
-   `PostToolUse`: Runs after tool execution (with optional matcher)
-   `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd`: Runs at session lifecycle events
-   `SubagentStop`: Runs when a subagent stops
-   `PreCompact`: Runs before conversation compaction
-   `Notification`: Runs on notification events

Example: Validate Bash Commands Before Execution

`{  "hooks":  {  "PreToolUse":  [  {  "matcher":  "Bash",  "hooks":  [  {  "type":  "command",  "command":  "python3 /path/to/validator.py"  }  ]  }  ]  }  }`

Example: Lint After Edits

`{  "hooks":  {  "PostToolUse":  [  {  "matcher":  "Edit",  "hooks":  [  {  "type":  "command",  "command":  "npm run lint"  }  ]  }  ]  }  }`

Windows/Linux Alternative for Sounds:

`{  "hooks":  {  "Stop":  [  {  "hooks":  [  {  "type":  "command",  "command":  "powershell -c (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer 'C:\\Windows\\Media\\Windows Ding.wav').PlaySync()"  }  ]  }  ]  }  }`

2\. Editor Setup (Cursor/VS Code)
---------------------------------

Master these shortcuts to keep your hands on the keyboard and navigate efficiently between editor, terminal, and Claude Code.

### Terminal Management

| Action | macOS | Windows/Linux | Custom Setup Required | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create Terminal in Editor Area | `CMD + SHIFT + C` | `CTRL + SHIFT + C` | ⚙️ Yes* | Open a new terminal as a tab in the editor (not bottom panel) |
| Rename Terminal | `CMD + SHIFT + R` | `CTRL + SHIFT + R` | ⚙️ Yes* | Label terminals by purpose (e.g., "dev server", "git", "tests") |
| Navigate Terminal Tabs | `CMD + SHIFT + [` / `]` | `CTRL + SHIFT + [` / `]` | ⚙️ Yes* | Switch between multiple terminal instances without using mouse |

*Note: These shortcuts require custom keybinding setup in Cursor/VS Code. See [Custom Keybinding Setup](https://www.shipkit.ai/courses/3e89f274-7891-4dbf-857a-d56679351603?section=4791a051-1d06-4eab-8eaa-e566c6a5e63b&page=40a58b27-1486-4edf-95d3-37d5d1cfc597#custom-keybinding-setup) below.

### Window & Pane Navigation

| Action | macOS | Windows/Linux | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Toggle Sidebar | `CMD + B` | `CTRL + B` | Hide/show file explorer when you need more screen space |
| Focus File Explorer | `CMD + SHIFT + E` | `CTRL + SHIFT + E` | Open and focus the file explorer sidebar |
| Toggle Terminal | `CTRL + `` | `CTRL + `` | Open/close the integrated terminal |
| Toggle Bottom Panel | `CMD + J` | `CTRL + J` | Show/hide bottom panel (terminal, output, problems) |
| Open Source Control | `CMD + SHIFT + G` | `CTRL + SHIFT + G` | View git changes and source control panel |
| Go to Line | `CMD + G` | `CTRL + G` | Jump to a specific line number in current file |
| Split Editor Pane | `CMD + \` | `CTRL + \` | View multiple files side-by-side |

| Close Current Pane | `CMD + W` | `CTRL + W` | Close the currently focused editor pane |
| Quick Open File | `CMD + P` | `CTRL + P` | Open files by name - faster than clicking through folders |
| Command Palette | `CMD + SHIFT + P` | `CTRL + SHIFT + P` | Access all VS Code/Cursor commands |

### File Operations

| Action | How To | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drag & Drop Images | Hold `SHIFT` while dragging | Add screenshots to Claude Code conversations |

### Keyboard-First Workflow Tips

-   Keep hands centered: Use keyboard shortcuts instead of reaching for mouse
-   Learn incremental search: `CMD/CTRL + F` for finding, `CMD/CTRL + H` for find/replace
-   Use breadcrumbs: `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + .` to navigate file structure
-   Master pane navigation: Use `CMD/CTRL + 1/2/3` to jump between split editors instantly

* * * * *

### Custom Keybinding Setup

The terminal management shortcuts above require custom configuration in Cursor/VS Code.

How to Set Up Custom Keybindings:

1.  Open Command Palette: `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + P`
2.  Type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
3.  Add your custom keybindings to `keybindings.json`

Example Keybindings:

`[  {  "key":  "cmd+shift+c",  "command":  "workbench.action.terminal.newInActiveWorkspace",  "args":  {  "location":  "editor"  }  },  {  "key":  "cmd+shift+r",  "command":  "workbench.action.terminal.rename"  },  {  "key":  "cmd+shift+[",  "command":  "workbench.action.terminal.focusPrevious"  },  {  "key":  "cmd+shift+]",  "command":  "workbench.action.terminal.focusNext"  }  ]`

For Windows/Linux: Replace `"cmd"` with `"ctrl"` in the keybindings above.

Note: These are example shortcuts - customize them to match your preferences! The video walkthrough will demonstrate the full setup process.

4\. Development Workflows
-------------------------

Practical workflows for common development tasks.

### Quick Review of Changes

Here's a typical workflow for reviewing changes after working with Claude:

1.  Open Source Control - `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + G`

    -   Review all file changes Claude made
    -   See git diff for each file
2.  Open File Explorer - `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + E`

    -   Navigate to specific files you want to check
    -   Browse the project structure
3.  Close Sidebar - `CMD/CTRL + B`

    -   Hide file explorer when done to maximize screen space
    -   Return focus to your code

This workflow keeps your hands on the keyboard and lets you efficiently review Claude's changes before committing.
