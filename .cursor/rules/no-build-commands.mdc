# Never Run Build Commands - Use Lint Instead

## Context
Build commands (`npm run build`, `next build`, etc.) are expensive operations that:
- Take significant time to complete (often 30+ seconds)
- Consume substantial system resources 
- Are not necessary for validating code changes during development
- Can mask underlying issues that should be caught earlier in the development process
- Are primarily meant for production deployment, not development validation

For code validation during development, lighter-weight commands like `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` provide faster feedback and catch the same categories of issues that would cause build failures.

## Rule
1. **Never suggest or run** `npm run build`, `next build`, or similar build commands during development sessions.
2. **Instead use** appropriate validation commands:
   - `npm run lint` - Check for linting errors and import issues
   - `npm run type-check` - Validate TypeScript types without building
   - `npm test` - Run test suites if available
3. **Build commands should only be used** for actual deployment or CI/CD pipelines.
4. **When testing code changes**, prefer incremental validation tools over full builds.

## Examples
| ❌ Bad (running build) | ✅ Good (using lint/type-check) |
|---|---|
| `npm run build --dry-run` | `npm run lint` |
| `next build` | `npm run type-check` |
| `npm run build 2>&1 \| head -20` | `npm run lint --fix` |

## Validation Strategy
For different types of changes:
- **Import path changes** → `npm run lint`
- **Type definition changes** → `npm run type-check`
- **Component logic changes** → `npm run lint` + `npm test`
- **Configuration changes** → `npm run lint` + manual testing

## Checklist for the Assistant
- [ ] Never suggest build commands for code validation during development.
- [ ] Use `npm run lint` to validate import paths and code quality.
- [ ] Use `npm run type-check` for TypeScript validation.
- [ ] Only mention build commands in the context of actual deployment.
- [ ] Prefer faster, incremental validation tools over comprehensive builds.

This ensures efficient development workflow and prevents unnecessary resource consumption during code validation.
