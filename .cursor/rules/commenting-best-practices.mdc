# Commenting Best Practices - Write Meaningful, Not Noisy Comments

## Context
Comments should enhance code readability and provide valuable context that isn't obvious from the code itself. The goal is to write self-documenting code with strategic, high-value comments.

**Key Principle**: Comments should explain *why*, not *what*. The code already shows *what* it does.

## Rule
1. **Write comments that add value** - explain business logic, decisions, and non-obvious behavior.
2. **NEVER write migration history comments** - they become outdated clutter.
3. **Avoid obvious comments** - if the code is self-explanatory, don't comment it.
4. **Keep comments concise and current** - outdated comments are worse than no comments.
5. **Use self-documenting code patterns** first, comments second.
6. **Focus on the "why" and "how"**, not the "what".

## Comments to AVOID

### ❌ Migration/History Comments
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Migration history clutter
// =============================================================================
// IMAGE UTILITIES - MOVED TO chat-utils-client.ts
// =============================================================================
export { validateImageFiles } from "./chat-utils-client";
```

```python
# ❌ Bad - Migration history clutter
# =============================================================================
# DATABASE UTILITIES - MOVED FROM old_db_utils.py
# =============================================================================
from .new_db_utils import get_user_data
```

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Clean and self-explanatory
export { validateImageFiles } from "./chat-utils-client";
```

```python
# ✅ Good - Clean and self-explanatory
from .new_db_utils import get_user_data
```

### ❌ Obvious/Redundant Comments
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - States the obvious
user.name = name;  // Set the user's name
counter++;         // Increment counter by 1
return result;     // Return the result
```

```python
# ❌ Bad - States the obvious
user.name = name    # Set the user's name
counter += 1        # Increment counter by 1
return result       # Return the result
```

### ❌ Outdated/Wrong Comments
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Comment doesn't match code
// Calculate total with 15% tax
const total = price * 1.08; // Actually 8% tax
```

```python
# ❌ Bad - Comment doesn't match code  
# Calculate total with 15% tax
total = price * 1.08  # Actually 8% tax
```

## Comments to WRITE

### ✅ Business Logic and Requirements
```typescript
function calculateDiscount(orderTotal: number, customerTier: string): number {
  // Premium customers get 15% discount on orders over $100
  // to encourage larger purchases and reward loyalty
  if (customerTier === 'premium' && orderTotal > 100) {
    return orderTotal * 0.15;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

```python
def calculate_discount(order_total: float, customer_tier: str) -> float:
    # Premium customers get 15% discount on orders over $100
    # to encourage larger purchases and reward loyalty
    if customer_tier == 'premium' and order_total > 100:
        return order_total * 0.15
    return 0.0
```

### ✅ Non-Obvious Technical Decisions
```typescript
async function uploadFile(file: File): Promise<UploadResult> {
  // Use chunked upload for files over 10MB to prevent timeout
  // and improve user experience with progress indication
  if (file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024) {
    return uploadFileChunked(file);
  }
  return uploadFileDirect(file);
}
```

```python
async def upload_file(file: File) -> UploadResult:
    # Use chunked upload for files over 10MB to prevent timeout
    # and improve user experience with progress indication
    if file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024:
        return await upload_file_chunked(file)
    return await upload_file_direct(file)
```

### ✅ Complex Algorithms or Math
```typescript
function calculateShippingCost(weight: number, distance: number): number {
  // Shipping cost formula: base rate + (weight factor × distance factor)
  // Base rate covers handling, weight accounts for capacity, distance for fuel
  const baseRate = 5.99;
  const weightFactor = weight * 0.1;
  const distanceFactor = distance * 0.05;
  return baseRate + (weightFactor * distanceFactor);
}
```

```python
def calculate_shipping_cost(weight: float, distance: float) -> float:
    # Shipping cost formula: base rate + (weight factor × distance factor)
    # Base rate covers handling, weight accounts for capacity, distance for fuel
    base_rate = 5.99
    weight_factor = weight * 0.1
    distance_factor = distance * 0.05
    return base_rate + (weight_factor * distance_factor)
```

### ✅ Important Warnings and Performance Notes
```typescript
async function deleteUser(userId: string): Promise<void> {
  // CRITICAL: This permanently deletes user data and cannot be undone.
  // All related records will also be deleted due to cascade constraints.
  await db.users.delete({ where: { id: userId } });
}
```

```python
async def delete_user(user_id: str) -> None:
    # CRITICAL: This permanently deletes user data and cannot be undone.
    # All related records will also be deleted due to cascade constraints.
    await db.users.delete(user_id)
```

## Self-Documenting Code Patterns

### Use Descriptive Names Instead of Comments
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Needs comments
const d = new Date();
const ms = d.getTime();
const s = ms / 1000; // Convert to seconds

// ✅ Good - Self-documenting
const currentDate = new Date();
const milliseconds = currentDate.getTime();
const seconds = milliseconds / 1000;
```

```python
# ❌ Bad - Needs comments
d = datetime.now()
ms = d.timestamp() * 1000
s = ms / 1000  # Convert to seconds

# ✅ Good - Self-documenting
current_date = datetime.now()
milliseconds = current_date.timestamp() * 1000
seconds = milliseconds / 1000
```

### Extract Methods with Clear Names
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Complex logic needs explanation
function processOrder(order: Order): void {
  // Validate, calculate total, check shipping eligibility...
  if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
    throw new Error("Order must have items");
  }
  // ... more complex logic
}

// ✅ Good - Extracted methods are self-documenting  
function processOrder(order: Order): void {
  validateOrderItems(order);
  order.total = calculateTotalWithTax(order.items);
  order.freeShipping = qualifiesForFreeShipping(order);
}
```

```python
# ❌ Bad - Complex logic needs explanation
def process_order(order: Order) -> None:
    # Validate, calculate total, check shipping eligibility...
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Order must have items")
    # ... more complex logic

# ✅ Good - Extracted methods are self-documenting
def process_order(order: Order) -> None:
    validate_order_items(order)
    order.total = calculate_total_with_tax(order.items)
    order.free_shipping = qualifies_for_free_shipping(order)
```

## Language-Specific Documentation

### TypeScript - JSDoc for Public APIs
```typescript
/**
 * Uploads a file with automatic retry and progress tracking
 * 
 * @param file - The file to upload
 * @param options - Upload configuration options
 * @returns Promise resolving to upload result with file URL
 * @throws {UploadError} When file size exceeds limit or upload fails
 */
async function uploadFile(file: File, options: UploadOptions = {}): Promise<UploadResult> {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### Python - Docstrings for Public APIs
```python
async def upload_file(file: File, options: UploadOptions = None) -> UploadResult:
    """Upload a file with automatic retry and progress tracking.
    
    Args:
        file: The file to upload
        options: Upload configuration options
        
    Returns:
        UploadResult: Upload result with file URL
        
    Raises:
        UploadError: When file size exceeds limit or upload fails
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## Special Cases

### TODO Comments - Be Actionable
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Actionable TODO with context
// TODO: Add input validation once user requirements are finalized (Sprint 3)
function processUserInput(input: string): void { }

// ❌ Bad - Vague TODO
// TODO: Fix this
```

### Complex Regex and Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Explain complex regex
// Match email format: local@domain.tld with basic validation
const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
```

```python
# ✅ Good - Explain complex regex  
# Match email format: local@domain.tld with basic validation
email_regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
```

## Checklist for the Assistant
- [ ] Write comments that explain "why" and business logic, not "what" the code does
- [ ] NEVER add migration history comments or "MOVED TO" comments
- [ ] Avoid obvious comments that restate what the code clearly shows
- [ ] Use self-documenting variable and function names instead of comments when possible
- [ ] Add comments for complex algorithms, business rules, and non-obvious technical decisions
- [ ] Include JSDoc/docstrings for public APIs and exported functions
- [ ] Remove or update comments when refactoring code
- [ ] Focus on future developer understanding, not implementation history

## Examples from This Project

### ❌ What NOT to do
```typescript
// =============================================================================
// IMAGE UTILITIES - MOVED TO chat-utils-client.ts
// =============================================================================
// Client-safe image utilities have been moved to chat-utils-client.ts
// to prevent server/client boundary violations. They are re-exported above.
```

### ✅ What TO do instead
```typescript
// Re-export client-safe utilities for backward compatibility
export { validateImageFiles, createImagePreview } from "./chat-utils-client";
```

**Remember**: Comments should focus on helping future developers understand the current implementation and business logic, not the code's history or migration path.


**Remember**: If you need to explain the code's history or migration, the code structure itself should make the current state clear. Comments should focus on helping future developers understand the current implementation and business logic.
