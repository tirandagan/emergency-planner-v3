# Do NOT Disable `react/no-unescaped-entities`

## Context
The linter rule `react/no-unescaped-entities` exists to prevent rendering raw apostrophes (`'`) and quotation marks (`"`) in JSX/HTML text nodes—characters that can break HTML or lead to XSS issues.

Some code has attempted to silence this rule with a file-level directive:

```tsx
/* eslint-disable react/no-unescaped-entities */
```

This **must never be used**. Doing so hides real problems instead of addressing them.

## Rule
1. **Never add** `/* eslint-disable react/no-unescaped-entities */` (or any variant such as `/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */`).
2. When the linter flags unescaped characters, **fix the root cause** by following the "Escape Apostrophes and Quotes in JSX/HTML" rule:
   • Replace the character with an HTML entity (`&rsquo;`, `&quot;`, etc.).  
   • Or embed the text in a JavaScript string expression that properly escapes it.  
   • Or rephrase the text to avoid the character.
3. Ensure the file passes linting **without** disabling the rule.

## Examples
| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| `/* eslint-disable react/no-unescaped-entities */` | `<p>Sarah&rsquo;s workflow</p>` |
| `// eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities` | `<blockquote>&ldquo;Time-saving&rdquo; tools.</blockquote>` |

## Checklist for the Assistant
- [ ] Never introduce any form of `eslint-disable` for `react/no-unescaped-entities`.
- [ ] Instead, correct unescaped characters as described in the escaping rule.
- [ ] Verify that the linter passes cleanly after your changes.

Violating this rule will lead to linter failures and must be avoided.
