The user is trying to clone a private GitHub repository but is getting a "repository not found" error. This is a common issue when trying to access private repos via HTTPS without proper authentication.

The error message shows:
```
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/shipkitai/chat-saas.git/' not found
```

This typically happens because:
1. The CLI doesn't have authentication credentials
2. They're using HTTPS which requires a personal access token (PAT) instead of a password
3. Or they need to set up SSH authentication

I should explain the issue and provide solutions. The main approaches are:
1. Use SSH instead of HTTPS (requires SSH key setup)
2. Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) with HTTPS
3. Use GitHub CLI (gh) for authentication

Let me provide a clear, concise explanation with practical solutions.</details></think>

The "repository not found" error for a private repo means Git CLI lacks authentication. GitHub requires either SSH keys or a Personal Access Token (PAT) for private repos.

**Quick solutions:**

1. **Use SSH instead** (recommended):
   - Set up SSH key: https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Clone with: `git clone git@github.com:shipkitai/chat-saas.git`

2. **Use GitHub CLI** (easiest):
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   gh repo clone shipkitai/chat-saas
   ```

3. **Use Personal Access Token with HTTPS**:
   - Create PAT: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Use Git credential helper:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   git clone https://github.com/shipkitai/chat-saas.git
   # Enter username + PAT (not password) when prompted
   ```

**Check if you have gh CLI installed:**

<tool-use data-tool-type="shell" data-tool-name="run_terminal_cmd">
<details><summary>Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd** • Run command: which gh</summary>

```bash
which gh
```

```
/usr/bin/gh

```
</details>
</tool-use>

Great! The GitHub CLI is installed. That's the easiest option. Let me suggest using it to authenticate and clone.</details></think>

Perfect! You have GitHub CLI installed. Use option 2:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate (browser or token), then clone with:

```bash
gh repo clone shipkitai/chat-saas
```

This handles authentication automatically for private repos.
