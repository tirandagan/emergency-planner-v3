**Pinpointing Store Implementation**

I'm currently zeroing in on the code that handles the `/store` route. My initial strategy is to search the codebase for files that might manage routing or render the store page. Once I identify the relevant component, I plan to integrate a clear "under development" notice, perhaps as a banner, to inform users.


**Initiating Route Discovery**

I've begun my search for the store route handler. My plan is to start with a keyword search for "store" across the codebase. I expect to find files related to routing or page rendering. Afterward, I'll analyze those files to pinpoint the exact location where I can insert the "under development" notice.

**Investigating the Component**

I'm currently focused on the `src/components/Store.tsx` file, as the search results clearly identify it as the core for the store page. My immediate task involves adding a "feature under development" notification within this component. I'm now delving into the file's structure to determine the most effective placement for this message.


**Assessing Store.tsx Placement**

I've initiated the reading of `src/components/Store.tsx` to understand its structure. My objective is to pinpoint the best spot to integrate the "feature under development" notification. I'm focusing on identifying the relevant sections for the store page layout to determine a suitable and noticeable location.

**Developing the Component**

I'm focusing on the `src/components/Store.tsx` component, specifically integrating a banner to mark the feature's developmental stage. My plan is to ensure the banner's styling aligns seamlessly with the existing design elements.


**Implementing the Banner**

The banner's HTML and styling are now ready. I've chosen `Construction` from `lucide-react` for the icon and used Tailwind classes to match the design language. Insertion will be just inside the main div container at line 28. The banner will clearly indicate the beta status, including a note about simulated orders. I also need to import the icon.

**Reviewing UI Update**

I've just added the "Under Construction" notice to the store page. Now, to make sure everything's shipshape, I'll run `read_lints` to catch any potential errors. Since this was a straightforward UI change, I'm confident it will be fine, but I'll double-check the file content for extra assurance.


**Verifying the Store Page**

I've already integrated the "Under Construction" message and now am getting ready to validate the updates. I'll execute `read_lints` to iron out any formatting wrinkles. Given the simplicity of the modifications, I'm expecting a clean bill of health, though I'll still do a final inspection of the file's structure.

**Verifying Completion & Next Step**

I've just added the "Under Construction" notice to `src/components/Store.tsx` as planned, and confirmed the file's contents. Running `read_lints` came back clean. Feeling confident with this solution, I'm ready to move on.


**Confirming Route and Closing**

I've reviewed `src/app/store/page.tsx` and confirmed it renders `<Store />`. This validates my earlier changes in `src/components/Store.tsx`. With that, I'm content, and I'm ready to consider this task complete.

The notice has been added to the `/store` page by updating `src/components/Store.tsx`.

### Changes
- Imported `Construction` icon from `lucide-react`.
- Added a banner at the top of the `Store` component with an "Under Construction" message and the `Construction` icon, styled with Tailwind CSS to match the tactical theme (yellow/warning colors).

### Verification
- `read_lints` confirmed no new linter errors.
- The code structure was verified by reading back the file.

```tsx:src/components/Store.tsx
// ... existing code ...
  return (
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12">
      <div className="bg-yellow-900/30 border border-yellow-700/50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-8 flex items-center gap-4">
        <Construction className="w-8 h-8 text-yellow-500 flex-shrink-0" />
        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-yellow-400 text-lg">Under Construction</h3>
          <p className="text-yellow-200/80">The Supply Drop marketplace is currently being provisioned. Inventory and checkout features are in beta preview.</p>
