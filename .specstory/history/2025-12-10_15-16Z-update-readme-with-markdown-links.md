<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to update the README.md file in ai_docs/prep/ to include links to each markdown file under the Structure section. Currently, the Structure section just lists the files with descriptions, but they're not links.

I need to convert each line in the Structure section from:
- `master_idea.md` - Core concept and vision

To:
- [`master_idea.md`](master_idea.md) - Core concept and vision

This will make them clickable links in the markdown file.

Let me do this update now.</details></think>

I'll update the README.md file to add clickable links to each markdown file in the Structure section.

Done! I've updated the README.md file to make all the markdown files in the Structure section clickable links. Each filename is now wrapped in markdown link syntax `[filename](filename)`, which will create clickable links when the README is viewed on GitHub or any markdown viewer.</details></think>

Done! I've updated the README.md file to convert all the markdown filenames in the Structure section into clickable links. Each file is now formatted as `[filename](filename)` which creates clickable links in markdown viewers and on GitHub.
