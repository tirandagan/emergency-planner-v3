<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is reporting a problem with pushing commits to GitHub. I need to investigate what's happening. Let me start by:

1. Checking the terminal output to see if there are any error messages
2. Looking at git status to understand the current state
3. Checking if there are any uncommitted changes or issues with the remote

Let me first list the terminals to see what's there, then check git status.</details></think>

I'll help you diagnose the GitHub push/sync issue. Let me check the current git status and any terminal output.

On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 6 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
  (commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)
	modified:   ai_docs/refs/chat-saas (modified content)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
	prompts/mission-generation/scenarios/emp-grid-down.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

You have uncommitted changes. Let me check what the actual push error is:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="shell" data-tool-name="run_terminal_cmd">
<details><summary>Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd** • Run command: cd /home/tiran/emergency-planner-v2 && git push</summary>

```bash
cd /home/tiran/emergency-planner-v2 && git push
```

The push actually succeeded. Your local commits have been pushed to GitHub.

However, you still have:
1. **Modified submodule** (`ai_docs/refs/chat-saas`) - the submodule has uncommitted changes inside it
2. **Untracked file** (`prompts/mission-generation/scenarios/emp-grid-down.md`)

If you want to commit these as well:

```bash
# Add and commit the new file
git add prompts/mission-generation/scenarios/emp-grid-down.md
git commit -m "Add EMP grid-down scenario"

# For the submodule, you need to go into it and commit changes there first
cd ai_docs/refs/chat-saas
git status  # Check what changed
git add .
git commit -m "Update chat-saas submodule"
cd ../../..
git add ai_docs/refs/chat-saas
git commit -m "Update chat-saas submodule reference"

# Then push
git push
```

Or if you want to discard the submodule changes:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

What would you like to do with these uncommitted changes?
