The user wants to check if the domain "refinemycv.com" is registered. I have access to a WHOIS lookup tool via MCP that can check domain availability. Let me use the `mcp_whois-lookup_check-domain-availability` tool to check this domain.</details></think>

I'll check if that domain is registered for you.

<tool-use data-tool-type="mcp" data-tool-name="mcp_whois-lookup_check-domain-availability">
<details>
          <summary>Tool use: **mcp_whois-lookup_check-domain-availability**</summary>
      
*Called tool*: whois-lookup - check-domain-availability: PURPOSE: Checks the availability of one or more domain names.
        INPUT: An array of domain names.
        OUTPUT: A JSON object containing two arrays: 'available' (domains that appear to be unregistered) and 'unavailable' (domains that appear to be registered). Note: Availability checks depend on WHOIS server responses and might not be 100% accurate for all TLDs or due to temporary network issues. Domains where lookup failed are omitted.
        WHEN TO USE: Use this tool when you need to determine if specific domain names can potentially be registered.
        EXAMPLE: { "domains": ["google.com", "example-domain-that-is-likely-free-12345.com"] }

*Parameters*:
  * domains: refinemycv.com

*Result*:
{
  "available": [],
  "unavailable": [
    "refinemycv.com"
  ]
}
</details>
</tool-use>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The domain refinemycv.com is registered (it appears in the "unavailable" list). This means someone already owns this domain.</details></think>

---

Yes, **refinemycv.com is already registered**. The domain is not available for purchase.

If you're looking for alternatives, you might consider variations like:
- refine-my-cv.com
- refinemyresume.com
- cvrefinery.com
- refinecv.com
- myrefinedcv.com

Would you like me to check availability for any alternative domain names?
