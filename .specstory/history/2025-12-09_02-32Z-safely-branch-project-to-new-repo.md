<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to know how to branch their project repository into a new repository that's linked to the current code, without affecting their current Render deployment which is synced to the current repo.

Let me break down what they're asking:
1. They want to create a new repository
2. This new repo should be linked/based on the current code
3. They don't want to affect their existing Render deployment (which is synced to the current repo)

This is a common scenario when you want to:
- Experiment with major changes without affecting production
- Create a derivative project
- Set up a separate deployment environment

The solution involves:
1. Creating a new Git repository that's based on the current one
2. Changing the remote origin to point to the new repository
3. This will leave the original repo untouched (and thus the Render deployment continues working)

Let me first check what the current git setup looks like to give more specific advice.</details></think>

To create a new repository from your current code without affecting the existing Render deployment:

## Quick Answer

1. **Create the new empty repository** on GitHub/GitLab/etc (don't initialize with README)
2. **Add the new repo as a remote and push**:
   ```bash
   git remote add new-origin <new-repo-url>
   git push new-origin main --all
   git push new-origin --tags
   ```
3. **Optional: Switch your local to use the new repo**:
   ```bash
   git remote rename origin old-origin
   git remote rename new-origin origin
   ```

This keeps the original repo (and Render deployment) completely untouched.

## Detailed Explanation

Your current repository is connected to Render for automatic deployments. When you push to that repo, Render deploys the changes. You want to create a new repository to work on without triggering those deployments.

**What you're doing:**
- Creating a duplicate repository with the full git history
- Maintaining a connection to the original code (they share the same git history)
- Your local workspace will track the new repository
- The old repository remains unchanged, so Render continues deploying from it

**Key points:**
1. Your original repo stays exactly as-is (Render is happy)
2. The new repo starts with identical code and full git history
3. They'll diverge from this point forward
4. You can later merge changes between them if needed (they share git ancestry)

**Alternative approaches:**

If you want to keep working with both repos locally:
```bash
# Keep original as 'origin', add new as 'new-repo'
git remote add new-repo <new-repo-url>
git push new-repo main --all

# Push to specific remotes as needed
git push origin main        # Updates old repo (triggers Render)
git push new-repo main      # Updates new repo (no Render)
```

Or create a completely fresh clone for the new repo:
```bash
# In a different directory
git clone <original-repo-url> new-project-name
cd new-project-name
git remote set-url origin <new-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

Which approach would you like to use? I can provide more specific commands if needed.
