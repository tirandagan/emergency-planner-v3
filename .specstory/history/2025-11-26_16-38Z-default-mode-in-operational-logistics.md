**Analyzing Default Modes**

I'm currently tracing the codebase to locate where "operational logistics" and its default mode, currently set to "BUG IN," are defined. My primary focus is pinpointing the exact location to enable a mode change to "VEHICLE" and ensure it doesn't break anything. I'm employing search tools to efficiently navigate the files.


**Initiating Code Search**

I've begun my search for "operational logistics" and "BUG IN" within the codebase. The goal is to pinpoint the exact locations where these terms are defined and utilized. I'm prioritizing direct matches to minimize irrelevant results. I'm carefully reviewing the initial hits to determine the best path for modifying the default mode to "VEHICLE."

**Analyzing Code Locations**

I've located instances of `MobilityType` within the codebase. Specifically, I've pinpointed its definition in `src/types.ts` and observed its usage within the `Planner.tsx` component, where it's managed via a `useState` hook. The initial state is set to `MobilityType.BUG_IN`.


**Identifying Related UI Elements**

I'm now investigating how the `mobility` state in `Planner.tsx` connects with the user interface. I'm searching for related UI labels or section names that could correspond to "operational logistics." I'll scrutinize the surrounding code within `Planner.tsx` to understand the context of the `mobility` state.

**Defining the Mobility Cards**

I'm currently focused on the mobility cards within the "Operational Logistics" section of `renderStep3` in `src/components/Planner.tsx`. My recent thought progression has been centered around understanding the default state of these cards, and how the mobility cards should be presented in the user interface. I'm exploring the implications for user interaction.


**Updating Default Mobility**

I've just confirmed the correct `MobilityType` enum member in `src/types.ts`. Now, I'm ready to update the default state in `src/components/Planner.tsx` from `BUG_IN` to `BUG_OUT_VEHICLE` as requested. I've also done a quick scan to make sure there aren't any other places where the "Operational Logistics" defaults are set.


**Refining Implementation Strategy**

I've confirmed the enum value is correct. My next step is to apply the code modification in `src/components/Planner.tsx`, changing the default `mobility` state. Following that, I plan to write a Playwright test to validate the correct default selection on the UI, ensuring "Bug Out (Vehicle)" is pre-selected upon reaching the "Operational Logistics" step. I'll need to account for navigating through the preceding steps to reach step 3.

**Confirming the Fix**

I'm currently working to validate the applied fix. The next step involves using Playwright. I'll launch the application and then use Playwright to traverse the wizard steps. Crucially, I'll confirm that on the "Operational Logistics" step, the default option, "Vehicle," is correctly selected.


**Assessing Application Startup**

Now I'm delving into how to launch the application for testing. My initial approach is to examine `package.json` to understand the startup procedures. Next, I'll leverage Playwright to navigate the wizard and confirm the expected default selection.

**Launching the Server and Testing**

I've got the dev server slated to launch in the background. My next step involves leveraging Playwright for the testing phase. To ensure everything runs smoothly, I plan to incorporate a short delay, allowing the server ample time to initialize before the tests begin.

**Testing the Flow**

I've just formulated a plan for testing the server. First, I'll navigate to localhost on port 3000. Then, I'll identify and click the "Get Started" button or its equivalent. Using Playwright, I will execute these steps.


**Defining the Steps**

I'm now detailing the test steps more precisely. I'm going to wait a beat for the server at port 3000. Playwright will then be my tool. First, I'll hit that URL. Next, I'll select the 'Get Started' element. Based on the code, I'll confirm the entry point, and determine if it's in the `src/app/page.tsx`. After that I'll look into how to select a scenario and enter a location to progress through the flow.

**Inspecting the Codebase**

I've been going through the project's structure, and just got to `src/components/Hero.tsx`. Seeing how this component is set up should help me understand the application's overall design. I'm looking for its role in the presentation and how it interacts with other parts.

**Assessing Navigation Links**

I'm currently focused on testing the hero component's link to the `/planner` route. My plan involves verifying the navigation functionality. I'll need to check the destination, then I'll examine the `src/app/planner/page.tsx` file for confirmation.

**Analyzing Component Rendering**

I've confirmed that the `/planner` route correctly renders the `Planner` component. My next step involves leveraging Playwright for testing. I'm focusing on writing the initial test setup, specifically utilizing `chromium` to launch a browser instance and navigate to the component.


**Developing Test Automation Script**

I'm currently working on building out the Playwright test script. The core actions are taking shape, encompassing navigation to the planner page, scenario selection (e.g., Natural Disaster), and input of a location. I've also added steps to interact with the "NEXT PHASE" buttons to advance the testing sequence. I'm now focused on validating the mobility options within the Operational Logistics stage.


**Evaluating Tool Integration**

I've realized a significant shift. The earlier approach of running a local Node.js script is incorrect. Instead, I need to use the `mcp_playwright` tools. My focus is now on adapting the existing code to use `mcp_playwright`, recognizing the distinct context. I'll need to rewrite the code to interact with the page through those tool calls, not just running code.


**Initiating Navigation Testing**

I'm now shifting to the `mcp_playwright` tool suite, specifically focusing on navigation. Instead of running a local script, I'll leverage `mcp_browser_run_code` to execute the Playwright code snippet within the browser context. My current goal is to navigate to the planner page as a test, using a more modular approach rather than running the entire script at once.

**Initiating the Actions**

I've observed the page load successfully. My next step involves selecting the "General Emergency" scenario by clicking the button. Following that, I'll type "New York" into the designated text box, and then initiate the "NEXT PHASE" by pressing the corresponding button. I'm leveraging `mcp_browser_click` and `mcp_browser_type` for the interactions.


**Refining the Approach**

I'm now fully focused on the execution. The plan is solidified: I will interact with the webpage as previously outlined, utilizing the designated actions. I'm ready to proceed with these steps, confirming the scenario selection, the text input, and the subsequent advancement to the next phase.

**Analyzing Button Activation**

I've just confirmed the "NEXT PHASE" button should now be enabled. My next step is to click it, but first, I need to ensure the text input functioned correctly, even though the snapshot didn't display the typed text. Then I'll click the button again, and I still need to get the ref for the button, which was in the first snapshot.

I'm making sure that the "NEXT PHASE" button is enabled before proceeding, as expected. I need to make sure the text input functioned correctly, although the snapshot didn't display the typed text. Then I'll click the button again, and I still need the ref for the button; it was `e70` in the first snapshot, which was disabled. The button is supposed to be enabled.

**Verifying Active State**

I'm focused on pinpointing the active button in "Operational Logistics." The snapshot lacks a clear indicator beyond occasional `[active]` markers. I'm currently scrutinizing Step 1, specifically the "General Emergency" button, to discern its selected state.


**Analyzing Button States**

I'm now investigating the "Vehicle" button's properties. I'll utilize `evaluate` on `ref=e1 78` to understand the applied classes and ascertain if the active state is signaled via the `className` conditional. It appears the "active" state is determined by comparing `mobility` with `m.type`.

**Analyzing the Argument**

I'm zeroing in on a potential snag: the `element` argument. It looks like the function isn't receiving the element as intended, or perhaps I'm overlooking how to supply the element reference. The documentation helpfully clarifies the function structure, which suggests the error is likely in my method of providing this element.


**Refining Element Targeting**

I'm now contemplating using the `mcp_browser_run_code` command. The initial approach might be flawed, as it seems I was struggling to pass the `element` correctly. Perhaps I should utilize this command to locate the element by text content and then grab its class. This method might circumvent the current issue.
