# Day-by-Day Simulation Generation Guidelines

Generate realistic, scenario-specific timelines that help families understand what to expect and how to respond during an emergency.

## Simulation Structure

### Duration Scaling
Adapt the simulation structure based on the planning duration:

| Duration | Structure |
|----------|-----------|
| 3 days | Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 (individual days) |
| 7 days | Day 1, Days 2-3, Days 4-5, Days 6-7 |
| 14 days | Day 1, Days 2-3, Days 4-7, Days 8-10, Days 11-14 |
| 30 days | Day 1, Days 2-3, Days 4-7, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4 |
| 90 days | Day 1, Days 2-7, Week 2, Weeks 3-4, Month 2, Month 3 |
| 365 days | Day 1, Week 1, Month 1, Months 2-3, Months 4-6, Months 7-12 |

### Day/Period Structure
Each day or period should include:

1. **Title**: Descriptive, scenario-appropriate (e.g., "Day 1: The First 24 Hours", "Week 2: Establishing Routines")
2. **Narrative**: 2-4 sentences describing what to expect, emotional state, key challenges
3. **Key Actions**: 2-4 bullet points of specific actions to take

## Scenario-Specific Narratives

### Natural Disaster
**Day 1 Focus**: Immediate safety, damage assessment, family accountability
**Days 2-3 Focus**: Resource inventory, communication with outside world, initial cleanup
**Days 4-7 Focus**: Establishing temporary routines, neighbor coordination
**Week 2+ Focus**: Recovery planning, insurance claims, rebuilding

**Key Themes**: Safety first, community cooperation, gradual normalization

### EMP/Grid Down
**Day 1 Focus**: Confirming the scope, protecting remaining electronics, water storage
**Days 2-3 Focus**: Cash on hand, manual cooking, news from battery radio
**Days 4-7 Focus**: Neighborhood coordination, security concerns, rationing
**Week 2+ Focus**: Bartering economy, long-term water/food solutions, community organization

**Key Themes**: Technology dependence realization, community building, self-reliance

### Pandemic
**Day 1 Focus**: Information gathering, isolation protocols, supply inventory
**Days 2-3 Focus**: Establishing home routines, remote work/school, limiting exposure
**Days 4-7 Focus**: Mental health strategies, exercise routines, news management
**Week 2+ Focus**: Social connection alternatives, extended isolation coping, healthcare access

**Key Themes**: Isolation management, information reliability, mental health

### Nuclear
**Day 1 Focus**: IMMEDIATE shelter, reducing exposure, sealing the environment
**Days 2-3 Focus**: Staying indoors, monitoring radiation levels, rationing supplies
**Days 4-14 Focus**: Awaiting all-clear, managing fear, limited outdoor exposure
**Week 3+ Focus**: Evacuation if possible, long-term health monitoring, community reconstruction

**Key Themes**: Radiation awareness, patience, government guidance

### Civil Unrest
**Day 1 Focus**: Situational awareness, securing home, avoiding attention
**Days 2-3 Focus**: Monitoring news, maintaining low profile, escape route planning
**Days 4-7 Focus**: Community relationships, security measures, resource management
**Week 2+ Focus**: Decisions about staying vs. leaving, longer-term safety planning

**Key Themes**: Gray man principle, community trust, situational awareness

### Multi-Year Sustainability
**Day 1 Focus**: Full inventory of resources, long-term mindset shift
**Days 2-7 Focus**: Immediate sustainability actions, skill assessment, planning
**Month 1 Focus**: Establishing production (garden, water, energy), community building
**Months 2-6 Focus**: Seasonal adaptation, skill development, trade relationships
**Months 7-12 Focus**: First harvest cycles, refinement of systems, long-term planning

**Key Themes**: Self-sufficiency, patience, community interdependence

## Family Composition Adjustments

### With Children (under 12)
- Include activities to keep children occupied
- Address explaining the situation age-appropriately
- Note special nutrition and comfort needs
- Include educational activities for extended scenarios

### With Teenagers (12-17)
- Assign age-appropriate responsibilities
- Address social isolation from peers
- Include productive tasks that build skills
- Note communication needs with friends

### With Elderly (65+)
- Emphasize medication management
- Note mobility and comfort considerations
- Include familiar routines for cognitive health
- Address temperature sensitivity

### With Medical Needs
- Include medication timing and management
- Note equipment power needs (if applicable)
- Address potential medical emergencies
- Include backup plans for treatment access

### With Pets
- Include feeding and care routines
- Note stress behaviors to watch for
- Address exercise and outdoor access
- Include comfort items and familiar routines

## Emotional Arc

Each simulation should acknowledge the emotional journey:

1. **Initial Shock/Fear** (Day 1): Acknowledge fear, focus on action to channel anxiety
2. **Adaptation** (Days 2-7): Finding new normal, small victories, frustrations
3. **Routine** (Week 2+): Acceptance, efficiency, boredom, hope
4. **Fatigue** (Extended): Acknowledge weariness, emphasize self-care
5. **Resolution/New Normal**: Light at end of tunnel, lessons learned, growth

## Practical Realism

### Include Realistic Challenges
- Power failures affecting food storage
- Communication difficulties
- Neighbor conflicts or cooperation
- Weather complications
- Supply shortages
- Boredom and cabin fever
- Sleep disruptions

### Avoid
- Overly optimistic outcomes
- Ignoring emotional toll
- Assuming perfect execution
- Forgetting about hygiene and sanitation
- Ignoring family dynamics under stress

## Key Actions Format

Each period's key actions should be:
- **Specific**: "Check water storage levels" not "manage resources"
- **Prioritized**: Most critical first
- **Achievable**: Realistic for the timeframe
- **Scenario-appropriate**: Different actions for different scenarios

Example:
```
**Key Actions:**
- Conduct morning security check of all entry points
- Rotate canned food stock (oldest first)
- 30-minute outdoor exercise (if safe) for mental health
- Evening family meeting to discuss tomorrow's priorities
```
