# Natural Disaster Scenario Guidance

## Scenario Context

Natural disasters include hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and severe winter storms. These events are location-specific, often provide some warning time, and typically affect infrastructure (power, water, roads) for 3-14 days.

## Critical Decision: Shelter-in-Place vs Evacuation

The most important decision for natural disasters is whether to stay or go. Your plan must address BOTH scenarios with clear decision criteria.

### Shelter-in-Place Indicators
- Local authorities recommend staying
- Property is structurally sound and above flood zones
- Adequate supplies can be stored safely
- Medical needs can be managed at home
- Roads may be impassable or dangerous

### Evacuation Indicators  
- Mandatory evacuation orders issued
- Property in high-risk zone (flood plain, wildfire path, coastal)
- Structural damage imminent (earthquake aftershocks, hurricane winds)
- Medical needs require hospital proximity
- Safe evacuation routes available with sufficient warning time

## Location-Specific Risks

### {{location}} Considerations
Based on the user's location, identify the primary natural disaster risks:

**Coastal Regions:**
- Hurricane season preparedness (June-November)
- Storm surge and flooding risks
- Evacuation route congestion
- Multi-day power outages
- Water contamination after storms

**Earthquake Zones:**
- Structural reinforcement priorities
- Drop-Cover-Hold drills
- Aftershock preparedness
- Gas/water line shut-off procedures
- Heavy rescue equipment

**Tornado Alley:**
- Designated safe room or shelter
- Weather alert systems (NOAA radio)
- 15-minute warning protocols
- Debris protection and cleanup
- Insurance documentation

**Flood Zones:**
- Elevation storage (2nd floor, high shelves)
- Rapid evacuation timing
- Waterproof document storage
- Sandbag deployment
- Mold prevention supplies

**Wildfire Regions:**
- Defensible space creation (100 ft clearance)
- N95 masks for smoke inhalation
- Evacuation trigger points
- Fire-resistant home hardening
- Multiple evacuation routes

**Winter Storm Areas:**
- Alternative heating sources
- Pipe freeze prevention
- Snow removal equipment
- Ice melt and traction aids
- Carbon monoxide detectors

## Supply Priorities for Natural Disasters

### Phase 1: Immediate Survival (0-72 hours)

## Evacuation Planning

### Pre-Planned Routes
Identify 3 evacuation routes from your location:
1. **Primary route:** Most direct, typically congested
2. **Secondary route:** Alternate path avoiding main highways
3. **Tertiary route:** Backroads route for extreme congestion

### Go-Bag Essentials (fits in vehicle, grab in 15 minutes)
- Water: {{go_bag_water}} gallons (3 days × family)
- Food: 3 days high-calorie, portable (MREs, bars)

- Hygiene: Minimal toiletries, wet wipes, hand sanitizer
- Tools: Multi-tool, flashlight, duct tape, paracord
- Communication: Phone chargers, portable radio
- Cash: $500-1000 in small bills

### Destination Planning
Identify 3 potential destinations:
1. **Friend/family:** Within 50-200 miles (outside disaster zone, close enough to reach)
2. **Hotel/shelter:** Pre-identified with reservations capability
3. **Alternate region:** If primary destinations compromised

## Skills to Develop

### Essential Skills for Natural Disasters
1. **First aid and CPR** - Medical help may be delayed
