# Nuclear Event Scenario Guidance

## Scenario Context

Nuclear events include nuclear weapon detonation, nuclear power plant accident, or radiological "dirty bomb" attack. The primary threats are **immediate blast effects** (for weapons), **radiation exposure**, and **radioactive contamination**. Survival depends on **immediate shelter**, **understanding fallout timing**, and **decontamination protocols**.

## Critical Understanding

Nuclear preparedness requires understanding radiation dynamics:
- **Immediate danger zone:** Blast radius (weapons only) - unsurvivable
- **Fallout pattern:** Radioactive particles carried by wind
- **Decay timeline:** Radiation intensity drops rapidly (7-10 rule)
- **Shelter timing:** When to shelter vs. when to evacuate
- **Decontamination:** Critical to prevent continued exposure
- **Food/water safety:** Contamination concerns
- **Long-term effects:** Radiation sickness, cancer risk

## The 7-10 Rule of Radiation Decay

**Most Important Concept for Nuclear Survival:**

For every **7-fold increase in time**, radiation intensity drops by a factor of **10**.

- **1 hour after detonation:** Baseline radiation level (100%)
- **7 hours after:** 10% of initial level (90% reduction)
- **49 hours (2 days) after:** 1% of initial level
- **2 weeks after:** 0.1% of initial level

**What This Means:**
- First 48 hours: STAY SHELTERED (deadly radiation outside)
- Days 3-14: Carefully venture out if absolutely necessary
- After 2 weeks: Radiation significantly reduced (still precautions needed)

## Immediate Response Timeline

### T-minus 0: Nuclear Detonation Detected

**If You See Flash (Close Proximity):**
1. **Look away immediately** - Flash can cause temporary/permanent blindness
2. **Drop and cover** - Shockwave coming (seconds to minutes depending on distance)
3. **Protect head and neck** - Flying debris from blast wave

**If You Hear Sirens/Alerts:**
1. **Get indoors IMMEDIATELY** - Any building better than outside
2. **Go to center of building** - Away from windows and exterior walls
3. **Basement if available** - Underground = best protection
4. **DO NOT look toward explosion** - Radiation and flash burns

### T+0 to T+15 minutes: Immediate Shelter

**Critical Window (Before Fallout Arrives):**

Fallout (radioactive particles) begins falling 15-60 minutes after detonation, depending on:
- Distance from blast
- Weather conditions (wind speed, direction)
- Altitude of detonation

**Your Actions:**
1. **GET INDOORS NOW** - Every second counts
2. **Seal the room:**
   - Close all windows and doors
   - Turn off HVAC (don't circulate contaminated air)
   - Seal vents with plastic and tape if available
   - Close fireplace dampers
3. **Move to shelter location:**
   - Basement center (best)
   - First floor center room (good)
   - Interior bathroom with no windows (acceptable)
   - Upper floors (worst - avoid if possible)
4. **Gather supplies quickly:**
   - Water containers
   - Food
   - Flashlights
   - Radio (battery/hand-crank)
   - First aid kit
   - Buckets for waste

### T+15 minutes to T+48 hours: Absolute Shelter Period

**DO NOT GO OUTSIDE. DO NOT OPEN WINDOWS. DO NOT LEAVE SHELTER.**

**During This Period:**
- Stay in shelter 24/7
- Radiation outside is DEADLY
- Use emergency toilet (bucket with bags)
- Ration water and food
- Monitor radio for official instructions
- Take potassium iodide if available (within 3-4 hours of exposure)
- Document timeline and any symptoms

**Shelter Protection Factor (SPF):**
- Vehicle: SPF 2 (doubles your survival odds - minimal)
- Wood frame house: SPF 2-5
- Brick house basement: SPF 40-200 (excellent)
- Concrete building center: SPF 50-100
- Underground shelter: SPF 1000+ (best)

### T+48 hours to T+2 weeks: Cautious Emergence

**After 48 hours, radiation drops to 1% of initial level.**

**You MAY venture out if:**
- Critically low on water or food
- Medical emergency
- Fire or structural danger
- Official evacuation order

**If You Must Go Outside:**
1. Cover all skin: Long sleeves, pants, gloves, boots
2. Wear N95 mask or respirator (prevent inhaling particles)
3. Minimize time outside (minutes, not hours)
4. Stay away from visible dust or debris
5. Return to shelter immediately after task
6. DECONTAMINATE THOROUGHLY (see protocol below)

### T+2 weeks+: Reduced Risk, Continued Precautions

**Radiation at 0.1% of initial level.**

- Shorter shelter periods acceptable
- Resume limited outdoor activities
- Decontamination still critical
- Avoid contaminated food/water
- Follow official guidance for evacuation if needed

## Shelter-in-Place Setup

### Ideal Shelter Location Priority

1. **Underground basement** - Center, away from exterior walls
2. **First-floor interior room** - Bathroom or closet with no windows
3. **Apartment building center** - Interior hallway away from exterior
4. **Any interior space** - Better than being outside

### Shielding Principles

**Radiation blocked by mass:**
- Earth/concrete: Excellent
- Brick: Very good
- Water: Good (can stack water jugs for shielding)
- Wood: Poor
- Metal: Minimal (thin layers)

**Create Additional Shielding:**
- Stack furniture around shelter area
- Fill containers with water, place around perimeter
- Use books, sandbags, soil-filled containers
- More mass between you and outside = better protection

### Shelter Supplies (Already Inside)

**Critical for 2-Week Shelter Period:**

**Water:**
- {{water_supply}} gallons minimum (1 gal/person/day × {{family_size}} × 14 days)
- Water from BEFORE event is safe
- After event: Assume all outdoor water contaminated

**Food:**
- {{food_supply}} for 14 days minimum
- No cooking needed (power likely out)
- Canned goods, MREs, energy bars
- No refrigeration required
- Can openers (manual)

**Sanitation:**
- 5-gallon buckets with lids (emergency toilet)
- Heavy garbage bags (line bucket)
- Toilet paper: {{tp_supply}}
- Hand sanitizer
- Wet wipes
- Plastic bags for waste

**Medical:**
- First aid kit (comprehensive)
- Prescription medications (30-day supply)
- Potassium iodide (KI tablets) - Protect thyroid from radioactive iodine
  - **Timing critical:** Take within 3-4 hours of exposure
  - Adult dose: 130 mg
  - Children 3-18: 65 mg
  - Infants: 32 mg
- Pain relievers, fever reducers
- Anti-diarrhea medication
- Antibiotic ointment

**Communication & Information:**
- Battery or hand-crank radio

- NOAA weather radio
- Flashlights/headlamps
- Writing materials (document timeline)

**Other Essentials:**
- N95 masks (50+ for {{family_size}} people)
- Plastic sheeting and duct tape (seal room)
- Work gloves (handling contaminated items)
- Garbage bags (multiple sizes)
- Bleach (decontamination solution)
- Manual can opener

## Decontamination Protocols

### Absolutely Critical After ANY Outdoor Exposure

**Contamination = Radioactive Particles on Skin/Clothing**

These particles continue radiating you until removed. Decontamination can reduce exposure by 90%+.

### Personal Decontamination (After Being Outside)

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Outside Entry Area (Before Entering Shelter):**
   - Remove ALL outer clothing
   - Place in plastic bag, seal, move far from shelter
   - Remove shoes, leave outside
   - Do NOT touch face or eat until decontaminated

2. **Transition Area:**
   - Brush off visible dust (gently, don't stir up)
   - Wipe down with damp cloths (disposable)
   - Remove remaining clothing
   - Seal all contaminated items in plastic bags

3. **Shower (If Water Available):**
   - Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water
   - Wash hair 2-3 times (DO NOT use conditioner - binds particles)
   - Scrub entire body with soap
   - Rinse at least 5 minutes
   - Water goes down drain (away from you)
   - Dry with clean towel
   - PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES (stored in shelter)

4. **If No Shower Available:**
   - Wet washcloths/wipes
   - Clean face, hands, exposed skin thoroughly
   - Change into clean clothes
   - Seal contaminated items

**CRITICAL: Do NOT scrub so hard you damage skin. Broken skin allows contamination entry.**

### Supplies Decontamination

**Items Brought from Outside:**
- Wipe with damp cloth
- Let items sit (decay reduces contamination)
- Double-bag if heavily contaminated
- Store away from shelter area

## Potassium Iodide (KI) Tablets

### Purpose
Radioactive iodine released in nuclear events concentrates in thyroid, causing cancer. KI saturates thyroid with non-radioactive iodine, preventing uptake of radioactive form.

### When to Take
- **Timing critical:** Within 3-4 hours of exposure
- Follow official guidance (alerts will specify)
- One dose usually sufficient
- DO NOT take "just in case" before event

### Who Should Take
- Everyone, especially children (most vulnerable)
- Pregnant/nursing women (protects baby too)
- Young adults up to 40

### Who Should Avoid
- Iodine allergies
- Certain thyroid conditions
- Over 40 (thyroid cancer risk lower, KI side effects higher)

### Dosage
- Adults: 130 mg
- Children 3-18 years: 65 mg
- Children 1 month-3 years: 32 mg
- Infants under 1 month: 16 mg

### Where to Get
- Pre-purchase and store (Amazon, pharmacies)
- Shelf life: 5-7 years
- Inexpensive ($10-20 for family pack)

**NOTE: KI only protects thyroid. It does NOT protect against other radiation or remove contamination.**

## Food and Water Safety

### Safe Water Sources

**SAFE (Before Event):**
- Stored water (sealed containers)
- Water inside pipes (first water out of tap after event)
- Bottled water

**UNSAFE (Contaminated):**
- Rain water after event
- Outdoor standing water
- Rivers, streams, ponds
- Wells (may be contaminated)

**If Must Use Potentially Contaminated Water:**
1. Let settle 24+ hours (particles sink)
2. Filter through cloth
3. Boil 1 minute (kills biological, does NOT remove radiation)
4. Drink only if no alternative (radiation exposure vs. dehydration)

### Safe Food Sources

**SAFE:**
- Sealed cans and packages (wipe exterior before opening)
- Food stored indoors before event
- Root vegetables underground (peel thick layer)

**UNSAFE:**
- Fresh produce outdoors during fallout
- Livestock exposed to fallout (milk, meat)
- Fish from contaminated water
- Game animals in contamination zone

**Food Safety Principles:**
- Peel fruits/vegetables (removes surface contamination)
- Wash all food if water available
- Do NOT eat food that was outside during fallout
- Sealed packaging protects contents (discard packaging)

## Evacuation Decision

### When to STAY (Shelter-in-Place)
- First 48 hours ALWAYS stay (radiation deadly outside)
- Official guidance says shelter
- Home provides adequate protection (basement especially)
- Evacuation route goes toward contamination
- Roads blocked or dangerous
- Adequate supplies in shelter

### When to EVACUATE
- Official evacuation order issued
- Structural damage to shelter (radiation exposure < collapse risk)
- Fire or other immediate danger
- After 2+ weeks, moving to cleaner area
- Severe supply shortage (no water)

### Evacuation Protocol

**If You Must Evacuate:**

1. **Timing:** After 48+ hours if possible (lower radiation)
2. **Route:** Perpendicular to wind direction (away from fallout path)
3. **Clothing:** Full coverage, N95 mask, gloves
4. **Vehicle:** Close windows, recirculate air (don't intake outside air)
5. **Supplies:** Bring all water, food, medical
6. **Speed:** Move quickly, minimize exposure time
