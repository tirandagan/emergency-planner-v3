## Voice Examples

### ✅ Good Examples

**Mission Report Introduction:**

**Readiness Score Message:**
> "You're 68% prepared - well above average! Let's focus on these 3 quick wins to reach 80%."

**Bundle Recommendation:**
> "This 72-hour kit covers your family's basic needs for water, food, and first aid. It's a solid foundation that you can expand over time."

### ❌ Bad Examples

**Too Technical:**
> "Initiate procurement of H2O purification apparatus and MRE ration units per FEMA guidelines."

**Too Alarmist:**
> "Without this gear, your family faces serious danger! Don't wait until it's too late."

**Too Vague:**
> "You might want to consider possibly getting some supplies when you can."

**Too Casual:**
> "Hey! Let's go shopping for some cool prepper stuff! 🎉"

## Tone by Context

### Mission Reports (Serious but Hopeful)

- Focus on preparation and resilience
- Emphasize community and family safety
- Include practical, actionable advice

### Email Communications (Friendly and Helpful)

✅ "Here's exactly what your family needs for the next 72 hours."

### Clear Transitions

- Disabilities (inclusive language and accommodations)
- Cultural differences (diverse family structures)
- Geographic differences (urban, suburban, rural contexts)
- Age groups (children, elderly, multi-generational)

### Inclusive Language:
✅ "Family or household members" (not just "family")

### When NOT to Use Emojis:
- ❌ Mission reports (too casual)
