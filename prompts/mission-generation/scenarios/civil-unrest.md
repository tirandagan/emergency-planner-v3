# Civil Unrest Scenario Guidance

## Scenario Context

Civil unrest includes protests, riots, civil disorder, economic collapse, martial law, and social instability. Unlike natural disasters, these are human-caused events where **personal security**, **low profile**, and **situational awareness** are critical. Duration can range from **days to weeks**, and may occur with **little to no warning**.

## Critical Understanding

Civil unrest preparedness is fundamentally about **avoiding danger and conflict:**
- **Personal safety first:** Avoid confrontation, stay out of affected areas
- **Low profile:** Don't attract attention or appear to have valuable supplies
- **Multiple exit strategies:** Know 3+ ways out of any situation
- **Situational awareness:** Understand what's happening and where
- **Gray man concept:** Blend in, don't stand out
- **Home security:** Protect your shelter without escalation
- **Resource invisibility:** Don't advertise preparedness

## Immediate Threat Recognition

### Warning Signs of Escalating Unrest

**Early Indicators (Hours to Days Before):**
- Large peaceful protests announced or gathering
- Social media coordination of demonstrations
- Political/economic tensions rising
- Police or military presence increasing
- Rumors of supply shortages or price increases
- Schools/businesses closing early
- Traffic patterns changing

**Immediate Indicators (Get to Safety NOW):**
- Crowds turning aggressive or violent
- Property damage (broken windows, fires)
- Looting beginning
- Police using riot control (tear gas, rubber bullets)
- Gunfire heard
- Roadblocks appearing
- Emergency services overwhelmed

### Your Immediate Response

**If You're at Home:**
1. **Stay home** - Safest place during unrest
2. **Secure the property:**
   - Lock all doors and windows
   - Close curtains/blinds (hide valuables, prevent targeting)
   - Move vehicles to garage or less visible location
   - Turn off exterior lights (don't attract attention)
3. **Monitor situation:**
   - Local news, police scanner, social media
   - Contact family members, ensure safe
   - Prepare to evacuate if situation deteriorates
4. **Stay out of sight:**
   - Keep noise down
   - No obvious signs of occupancy
   - Lights minimal and internal only

**If You're Away from Home:**
1. **Assess safety:**
   - Can you get home safely?
   - Are routes blocked or dangerous?
   - Is staying put safer?
2. **If going home:**
   - Take alternate routes (avoid crowds, unrest areas)
   - Drive calmly, don't speed (attract attention)
   - Have backup routes planned
   - Keep doors locked, windows up
3. **If staying put:**
   - Find secure location (friend's house, hotel away from unrest)
   - Contact family, let them know situation
   - Monitor for safe window to return home

**If You're Caught in Unrest:**
1. **Leave immediately:** Don't watch, don't engage, GO
2. **Move perpendicular** to crowd movement (not against, not with)
3. **Stay on edges:** Easier to exit, less crush risk
4. **Protect yourself:**
   - Cover face (tear gas, identification)
   - Protect head if projectiles
   - Run if violence escalates
5. **Find sanctuary:**
   - Businesses, restaurants (lock yourself in)
   - Police/fire stations
   - Government buildings
   - Anywhere away from the crowd

## Supply Priorities for Civil Unrest

### Phase 1: Immediate Safety (Days 1-3)

**Home Security (Without Looking Fortified):**
- **Reinforced entry points:**
  - Door reinforcement (longer screws, strike plates)
  - Security bars (interior, not visible from outside)
  - Backup locks (portable door braces)
  - Window locks upgraded
- **Perimeter awareness:**
  - Security cameras (wireless, rechargeable)
  - Motion sensor lights (interior trigger, not exterior)
  - Noise makers (wind chimes, gravel)
  - Dog (real or fake bark alarm)
- **Deterrence without attention:**
  - "Beware of Dog" sign (even if no dog)
  - Occupied appearance (lights on timer)
  - Avoid valuables visible from outside
  - No security cameras obvious from street (hidden or subtle)

**Personal Security:**
- **Communication:**
  - Cell phone (charged, backup battery)
  - Two-way radios (family coordination)
  - Police scanner app
  - Whistle (emergency signal)
- **Self-Defense:**
  - Pepper spray (legal in most areas)
  - Flashlight (tactical, can disorient)
  - [Appropriate to user's situation, legality, and comfort level]
- **Documentation:**
  - Camera/phone (document threats if safe)
  - Insurance documents (claim property damage)
  - Emergency contacts list

**Supplies (Already at Home):**
- Water: {{water_supply}} gallons (1 week minimum)
- Food: 7-14 days (NO COOKING - avoid smoke/smells attracting attention)
- First aid: Comprehensive trauma kit (violence-related injuries)
- Fire extinguisher: Multiple (arson risk)
- Cash: $500-1,000 (ATMs may be down, cards not accepted)
- Fuel: Vehicles fully fueled (evacuation readiness)

### Phase 2: Extended Unrest (Days 4-14)

**Community Dynamics:**
- Neighbor coordination (mutual security)
- Information sharing (which areas safe/dangerous)
- Resource pooling (IF trusted neighbors only)
- Avoid vigilante groups (escalates danger)

**Extended Supplies:**
- Food: 30 days shelf-stable
- Medical: Expanded first aid, prescriptions
- Sanitation: May avoid leaving house at all
- Entertainment: Low-key (no loud activities)
- Backup plans: Multiple evacuation routes and destinations

**Low-Profile Lifestyle:**
- Minimal exterior activity (don't show supplies)
- Quiet operations (no generator noise)
- Light discipline (blackout curtains, minimal external lights)
- No trash on curb (hide consumption levels)
- Ordinary appearance (well-maintained, not fortified)

## Evacuation Strategy

### When to Evacuate (Pre-Planned Trigger Points)

**Evacuate If:**
- Direct threats to property or safety
- Fire approaching (arson nearby)
- Unrest escalating in your area
- Police advise leaving
- No safe way to access supplies
- Violence at your doorstep
- Structural damage to home

**Do NOT Evacuate If:**
- Unrest hasn't reached your area
- Roads are more dangerous than staying
- Evacuating into affected areas
- Home provides adequate safety
- Supplies sufficient to wait it out

### Evacuation Protocol

**Pre-Event Preparation:**
- Identify 3 destinations (different directions)
  1. Friend/family 50+ miles away
  2. Hotel in safe area (pre-researched)
  3. Alternate city/town (backup)
- Map multiple routes to each (avoid main roads)
- Pre-pack vehicle or have bags ready
- Communication plan (where to meet if separated)
- Important documents in waterproof bag (grab-and-go)

**Evacuation Execution:**
1. **Timing:** Leave early (before routes blocked) or wait until unrest passes
2. **Vehicle:**
   - Full tank (gas stations may close)
   - Doors locked, windows up
   - Nothing valuable visible inside
   - Navigation ready (backup paper maps)
3. **Route:**
   - Avoid downtown, protest areas, police activity
   - Take backroads, residential routes
   - Stay alert for roadblocks or crowds
   - Have backup routes ready
4. **Gray man principle:**
   - Ordinary vehicle (not flashy or "tactical")
   - Normal clothes (not military or prepper gear)
   - Calm demeanor (don't look scared or aggressive)
   - Blend in, don't stand out

## Personal Security Without Escalation

### Home Defense Philosophy

**Goal: Deter, not Engage**

Most threats will move on if your home looks:
- Occupied (lights, movement)
- Secure (reinforced, not easy target)
- Low-value (nothing obvious to steal)
- Risky (dog, cameras, occupied neighbors)

**Avoid:**
- Fortified appearance (attracts attention: "They have something to protect!")
- Confrontation (violence begets violence)
- Solo defense (work with neighbors)
- Shooting unless life in immediate danger (legal and ethical consequences severe)

### Layered Security Approach

**Layer 1: Deterrence (Prevent Targeting)**
- Keep low profile (curtains closed, minimal external signs)
- Ordinary appearance (not fortress, not abandoned)
- Neighborhood coordination (occupied area safer)
- Signs of occupancy (lights, sounds)

**Layer 2: Delay (Slow Down Intruders)**
- Reinforced doors and locks
- Window locks and bars (interior)
- Thorny plants at windows (physical barrier)
- Visible (subtle) security measures

**Layer 3: Detection (Know When Threat Present)**
- Security cameras (record evidence)
- Motion sensors and alarms
- Dogs or dog alarm devices
- Neighborhood watch communication

**Layer 4: Response (Protect Life)**
- Safe room (reinforced interior room)
- Communication (call 911, even if delayed response)
- [Appropriate defensive measures for user's situation]
- Documentation (video, photos if safe)

## Situational Awareness

### The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)

**Observe:**
- What's happening around you?
- Where are the threats?
- What are exit routes?
- Who is nearby (friend, foe, neutral)?

**Orient:**
- What does this situation mean?
- How does it affect your safety?
- What are your options?

**Decide:**
- Best course of action (stay, leave, defend)?
- Backup plan if first choice fails?

**Act:**
- Execute decision calmly and quickly
- Adapt as situation changes

### Threat Assessment

**Green (Normal):**
- Normal daily activities
- No unusual activity
- Routine awareness sufficient

**Yellow (Alert):**
- Elevated tensions
- Protests or crowds forming
- Increased security presence
- Monitor situation closely

**Orange (Danger Nearby):**
- Violence occurring in area
- Property damage visible
- Unsafe to be outside
- Prepare to evacuate or defend

**Red (Immediate Threat):**
- Threat at your location
- Violence directed at you/property
- Life in danger
- Act immediately (flee or defend)

## Location Considerations for {{location}}

### Urban Areas (Highest Risk)
**Challenges:**
- Dense population = more unrest potential
- Riots/protests concentrated in cities
- Limited escape routes (congestion)
- Resource competition
- Visible wealth disparity (targeting)

**Strategies:**
- Extended supplies (can't leave easily)
- Multiple evacuation routes (practice them)
- Neighborhood alliances (mutual security)
- Very low profile (blend into urban environment)
- Secure apartment (interior units safer than ground floor)

### Suburban Areas (Moderate Risk)
**Challenges:**
- Targeted by those leaving cities
- Perception of wealth (nice houses)
- Less community cohesion than rural
- Still dependent on outside supplies

**Strategies:**
- Neighborhood security coordination
- Appearances matter (ordinary, not wealthy or fortified)
- Early evacuation trigger (before exodus from cities)
- Multiple supply caches (home, vehicle, alternate location)

### Rural Areas (Lower Direct Risk, Different Challenges)
**Challenges:**
- May face refugees from cities
- Limited law enforcement (remote)
- Self-reliance critical
- Strangers more obvious (outsiders)

**Advantages:**
- Tight-knit communities (known neighbors)
- Natural barriers and space
- More defendable property
- Less attractive target (perceived lower resources)

**Strategies:**
- Community coordination critical
- Welcome some, deter others (balance hospitality and security)
- Supplies less obvious (space to hide storage)
- Established networks (everyone knows everyone)

## Family-Specific Considerations

### For Families with Young Children ({{has_children}})
- **Explanation:** Age-appropriate discussion (avoid scaring, but prepare)
- **Quiet activities:** Books, coloring, quiet games (avoid attracting attention)
- **Security role:** Kids don't answer door, stay away from windows
- **Evacuation practice:** Fire drill-style practice (make it routine, not scary)
- **Comfort items:** Familiar toys, blankets reduce stress

### For Teenagers ({{has_teens}})
- **Communication plan:** Ensure they can get home or to safety
- **Social media awareness:** Don't post locations or plans
- **Situational training:** Teach OODA loop, threat assessment
- **Responsibility:** Age-appropriate security roles (monitoring, communication)
- **Peer pressure:** Resist urge to watch or participate in unrest

### For Elderly or Disabled ({{has_elderly}})
- **Mobility planning:** Evacuation assistance if needed
- **Medications:** Extended supply (can't easily get refills during unrest)
- **Communication:** Check-ins regular, emergency alert system
- **Security role:** Observation, communication (don't require physical response)
- **Comfort:** Reduce stress, maintain routine where possible

### For Pets ({{has_pets}})
- **Security asset:** Dogs deter intruders, provide early warning
- **Control:** Keep pets quiet during high-risk periods (barking attracts attention)
- **Supplies:** 30-day food/water (may not be able to get more)
- **Evacuation:** Carriers ready, leashes accessible
- **Identification:** Ensure microchip/tags current

## Economic Considerations

### Financial Preparedness

**Cash on Hand:**
- $500-1,000 in small bills ($1, $5, $10, $20)
- ATMs may be down or empty
- Credit cards may not work (power out, systems down)
- Exact change important (no one has change to break $100)

**Banking Limits:**
- Withdraw cash BEFORE unrest peaks
- Bank closures possible
- Daily withdrawal limits may be imposed
- Online banking may be accessible when physical banks closed

**Barter Economy:**
- Small valuable items (alcohol, tobacco, coffee)
- Services (skills others need)
- Supplies others lack (first aid, batteries, water filters)
- Be discreet (don't advertise what you have)
