# Pandemic Scenario Guidance

## Scenario Context

Pandemics are infectious disease outbreaks that spread widely across regions or globally. Unlike other disasters, pandemics require **isolation and quarantine** rather than evacuation, last for **weeks to months**, and demand strict **hygiene and medical protocols**. The challenge is maintaining isolation while ensuring adequate supplies and preventing disease transmission.

## Critical Understanding

Pandemic preparedness is fundamentally different from other scenarios:
- **Isolation required:** Must stay home for extended periods (30-90+ days)
- **No evacuation:** Leaving increases exposure risk
- **Medical focus:** PPE, sanitation, and disease prevention are critical
- **Supply chain disruption:** Stores may have limited inventory
- **Healthcare overwhelm:** Hospitals may be at capacity
- **Social distance:** Avoid all unnecessary contact
- **Long duration:** Multiple waves possible over 12-24 months

## Immediate Pandemic Response (First 24 Hours)

### When Pandemic Declared or Cases Surge Locally

**Your Immediate Actions:**
1. **Complete supply run IMMEDIATELY** - Before panic buying empties shelves
2. **Cancel all non-essential activities** - Work from home, school remote, avoid gatherings
3. **Establish quarantine zone** - Designate entry area for disinfection
4. **Stock up on PPE** - Whatever is still available (masks, gloves, sanitizer)
5. **Prepare isolation room** - If household member gets sick
6. **Communication plan** - Set up video calls with family, avoid in-person contact
7. **Medical baseline** - Take temperatures, document any symptoms

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Wait to see how serious it is (by then, shelves are empty)
- ❌ Continue normal social activities (spreads disease)
- ❌ Panic buy irresponsibly (causes community-wide shortages)
- ❌ Ignore early symptoms (early treatment is critical)
- ❌ Share supplies across households (cross-contamination risk)

## Supply Priorities for Pandemic

### Phase 1: Isolation Essentials (First 30 Days)

**Personal Protective Equipment (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
- **Masks:** N95 or KN95 (50+ for {{family_size}} people)
  - Medical-grade respirators preferred

**Caregiver Protocol:**
- ONE designated caregiver (limit exposure)
- Full PPE every interaction
- Leave food/meds at door, knock, retreat
- Disinfect all surfaces in sick room daily
- Separate laundry (wash on hottest setting)
- Monitor own symptoms closely

## Medical Management

### Symptom Monitoring

**Daily for All Household Members:**
