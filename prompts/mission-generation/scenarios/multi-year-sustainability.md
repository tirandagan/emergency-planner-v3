# Multi-Year Sustainability Scenario Guidance

## Scenario Context

Multi-year sustainability planning prepares for **prolonged societal disruption** lasting months to years. This could result from **economic collapse**, **extended grid failure**, **cascading infrastructure breakdown**, or **long-term resource scarcity**. The focus shifts from "surviving an event" to **sustainable living** without modern infrastructure and supply chains.

## Critical Understanding

Multi-year preparedness is fundamentally different from short-term survival:
- **Self-sufficiency required:** You cannot buy what you need
- **Skills over supplies:** Knowledge and ability trump stockpiles
- **Food production:** Must grow/raise your own calories
- **Community essential:** No one survives alone long-term
- **Adaptability critical:** Situations change, flexibility key
- **Psychological resilience:** Mental strength as important as physical
- **Generational thinking:** Plan for years, not months

## Reality Check

**Most Important Point:** Complete self-sufficiency is nearly impossible. Even subsistence farmers throughout history relied on communities, trade networks, and specialized skills. Your goal is **maximum self-reliance with strategic interdependence**.

## Sustainability Timeline

### Months 1-3: Transition Period (Using Stored Supplies)

**Primary Activities:**
- Establish food production immediately (gardens, livestock)
- Develop water sources (wells, catchment, purification)
- Secure shelter and property
- Build community relationships and trade networks
- Develop essential skills through practice
- Preserve remaining modern supplies (medicine, tools)

**Stockpiled Supplies Still Available:**
- Most stored food remaining
- Medications (beginning to deplete)
- Fuel reserves
- Tools and equipment (new condition)
- Seeds for planting

**Challenges Emerging:**
- Learning curve on food production
- Community dynamics forming
- Resource management decisions
- Priority conflicts (multiple urgent needs)

### Months 4-12: Establishment Period (First Harvests)

**Primary Activities:**
- Harvest first crops (if planted in months 1-3)
- Establish preservation methods (canning, smoking, drying)
- Expand food production based on lessons learned
- Develop livestock to maturity (chickens, rabbits)
- Create sustainable water systems
- Build/improve shelter and infrastructure
- Establish trade relationships with neighbors
- Develop income/trade skills

**Supply Situation:**
- Stored food depleting (relying on production)
- Medications mostly exhausted (shift to alternatives)
- Fuel very limited (conserve for critical use only)
- Tools wearing (maintenance critical)
- Fresh food available (seasonal)

**Psychological State:**
- Adjustment exhaustion (hard work, uncertainty)
- Community tensions (resource conflicts)
- Mourning old lifestyle
- Small victories (first harvest, successful preservation)

### Years 2-3: Sustainability Achieved (Self-Reliant Systems)

**Primary Activities:**
- Food production routine and reliable
- Preservation fills shelves for winter
- Livestock reproduction cycle established
- Trade networks functional
- Skills developed and practiced
- Community roles defined
- Mental adaptation complete (new normal accepted)

**Supply Situation:**
- Stored supplies exhausted (except tools, seeds)
- Completely reliant on production and trade
- Fuel gone (manual labor, animal power, renewable)
- Modern medicine gone (herbal, traditional methods)
- Everything repaired/maintained (no buying new)

**Psychological State:**
- Acceptance of new reality
- Pride in accomplishments
- Grief processed
- Community bonds strong
- Purpose and meaning in daily work

## Food Production Strategy

### The 4-Pronged Approach

**1. Gardening (Primary Calories):**

**Immediate Start (Within First Week):**
- Location: Sunny area, 600-1000 sq ft per person
- Soil preparation: Compost, amendments if available
- Priority crops (calories per square foot):
  - Potatoes: 20,000+ calories per 100 sq ft
  - Corn: 15,000 calories per 100 sq ft
  - Beans: 10,000+ calories, nitrogen-fixing
  - Winter squash: 8,000+ calories, stores months
  - Cabbage: Hardy, stores well

**Succession Planting:**
- Stagger plantings (harvest spread over time)
- Cool season: Cabbage, broccoli, lettuce, peas
- Warm season: Tomatoes, beans, squash, peppers
- Fall crops: Kale, carrots, beets, turnips

**Year-Round Production:**
- Spring: Peas, lettuce, spinach, radishes
- Summer: Tomatoes, beans, squash, corn, potatoes
- Fall: Cabbage, kale, carrots, beets
- Winter: Greenhouse (if available) or stored crops

**Seeds:**
- HEIRLOOM ONLY (can save seeds)
- Store 3-5 years of seeds (backup for failures)
- Seed saving technique (learn first season)
- Diversity (20+ crop types for nutrition, failure redundancy)

**2. Livestock (Protein and Fats):**

**Chickens (Easiest, Start Immediately):**
- **Eggs:** 6 hens = 4-5 eggs/day (2,000 calories/week)
- **Meat:** Excess roosters, old hens (protein source)
- **Requirements:** Coop (predator-proof), feed (supplement foraging), water
- **Advantages:** Fast reproduction, low space, multi-purpose (eggs, meat, pest control)
- **Timeline:** Chicks to laying = 5-6 months

**Rabbits (Second Priority, Month 2-3):**
- **Meat:** 1 doe = 40-50 lbs meat/year
- **Requirements:** Hutches, forage/feed, breeding stock
- **Advantages:** Reproduce quickly, quiet, small space
- **Timeline:** Birth to butcher = 8-12 weeks

**Goats (Advanced, Year 1+ if space):**
- **Milk:** 2-3 quarts/day per goat (dairy = nutrition variety)
- **Meat:** Kids can be meat source
- **Requirements:** Fencing, shelter, forage/hay, breeding
- **Advantages:** Milk, meat, land clearing, hardy
- **Challenges:** Space, fencing, veterinary knowledge

**3. Foraging (Supplemental):**
- **Wild edibles:** Learn local plants (dandelion, clover, cattails, acorns, berries)
- **Mushrooms:** ONLY if expert (poisoning risk fatal)
- **Fishing:** If water sources available
- **Hunting:** If legal, experienced, and sustainable population
- **Caution:** Don't rely on foraging for calories (unreliable, depletes local resources)

**4. Food Preservation (Critical for Year-Round Food):**

**Methods:**
- **Canning:** High-acid foods (tomatoes, pickles) water bath; low-acid (meat, beans) pressure canner
- **Drying:** Fruits, vegetables, herbs, meat (jerky)
- **Smoking:** Meat, fish (preservation + flavor)
- **Root cellar:** Potatoes, carrots, beets, squash, cabbage (months of storage)
- **Fermentation:** Sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles (nutrition + probiotics)
- **Salt curing:** Meat (requires significant salt stockpile)
- **Freezing:** IF power available (solar, generator)

**Supplies Needed:**
- Pressure canner (essential for low-acid foods)
- Canning jars (100+ quarts), lids, rings
- Salt (100+ lbs for preservation)
- Sugar (if available, for jams/preserves)
- Vinegar (pickling)
- Dehydrator (or sun drying racks)
- Smoker (DIY from barrel or dedicated unit)

## Water Systems

### Sustainable Water Sources

**1. Well (Best Long-Term):**
- Hand pump or windmill (no electricity needed)
- Depth varies by location
- Professional drilling OR hand-dug shallow well
- Cost: $3,000-15,000+ professional, $500-2000 DIY shallow
- **Advantage:** Reliable, clean (usually)
- **Challenge:** Initial cost, maintenance

**2. Spring/Stream:**
- Natural flowing water
- Requires filtration/purification
- May be seasonal
- **Advantage:** Free, renewable
- **Challenge:** Contamination risk, may dry up

**3. Rainwater Catchment:**
- Roof collection (2,000 sq ft roof + 1" rain = 1,250 gallons)
- Storage tanks (food-grade)
- Filtration required
- **Advantage:** Free after setup
- **Challenge:** Seasonal (no rain = no water), storage limits

**4. Pond/Lake:**
- Natural or created
- Requires significant filtration
- Sustainability concern (over-use)
- **Advantage:** Large volume
- **Challenge:** Contamination, algae, seasonal

### Water Purification Methods (Multi-Year)

**Filtration:**
- Ceramic filters (British Berkefeld, Doulton) - 10+ year lifespan
- Sand/gravel/charcoal filter (DIY, renewable)
- Cloth pre-filter (remove sediment)

**Chemical:**
- Bleach (8 drops/gallon, stores 1 year) - stockpile limited
- Calcium hypochlorite (pool shock, makes bleach solution) - stores longer
- Iodine (limited supply) - stockpile exhausts

**Boiling:**
- 1 minute rolling boil (3 minutes high altitude)
- Requires fuel (wood renewable, propane limited)
- Always safe method

**Solar disinfection (SODIS):**
- Clear bottles + sunlight (6 hours) = UV kills pathogens
- Free, renewable
- Slow, limited volume

## Shelter and Infrastructure

### Housing Priorities

**Year 1: Weatherproof and Secure:**
- Roof watertight (leaks = structural damage)
- Windows and doors sealed (heat loss)
- Insulation adequate (winter survival)
- Basic security (locks, reinforcement)
- Wood stove or alternative heat (if cold climate)

**Year 2-3: Improvements and Efficiency:**
- Root cellar (food storage)
- Workshop (repair and production space)
- Greenhouse (extend growing season)
- Animal shelters (chickens, rabbits, goats)
- Outdoor kitchen (summer cooking, preserve indoor heat)
- Composting toilet (if water scarce)

### Energy Sources

**Heating:**
- Wood stove (primary for cold climates)
- Wood supply: 3-5 cords/year (cold climate)
- Sustainable harvesting: Coppicing, deadfall collection
- Rocket mass heater (DIY, extreme efficiency)

**Cooking:**
- Wood fire (outdoor summer, indoor winter)
- Rocket stove (highly efficient, minimal fuel)
- Solar oven (summer, free energy)
- Retained heat cooking (hay box cooker)

**Lighting:**
- Solar path lights (charge day, use night)
- Oil lamps (stockpile oil, or render animal fat)
- Candles (make from beeswax or tallow)
- Early to bed lifestyle (follows daylight)

**Power (If Budget Allows):**
- Solar panels (charge batteries, small devices)
- Micro-hydro (if stream available)
- Wind turbine (if windy location)
- **Reality:** Minimal power, prioritize critical uses
