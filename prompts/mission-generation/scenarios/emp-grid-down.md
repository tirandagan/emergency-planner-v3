# EMP / Grid Down Scenario Guidance

## Scenario Context

An Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) or prolonged grid-down situation would disable most electronics and electrical infrastructure. This scenario requires preparation for long-term (months to years) self-sufficiency without modern conveniences. Unlike natural disasters, there may be NO warning and NO clear recovery timeline.

## Critical Understanding

This is the MOST challenging scenario because:
- **No electronics:** Most vehicles, phones, appliances rendered useless
- **No power grid:** Could take months/years to restore
- **No supply chain:** Stores empty within days
- **Long duration:** Must prepare for multi-month to multi-year sustainability
- **Communication breakdown:** No internet, cell, or traditional media
- **Social instability:** Resource competition, potential breakdown of order

## Immediate Post-EMP Reality (First 72 Hours)

### What Will Happen
- **Electronics fail:** Anything with microchips (newer cars, phones, computers)
- **Power grid down:** Instantaneous nationwide blackout
- **Water systems fail:** Pumps stop, taps run dry within hours
- **Stores emptied:** Panic buying clears shelves in 24-48 hours
- **Gas stations useless:** No power for pumps (even if you have cash)
- **Banking system down:** No ATMs, cards, or electronic payments
- **Communication blackout:** No phone, internet, or broadcasts (possibly)
- **Emergency services overwhelmed:** 911 may not function

### Your Immediate Actions
1. **Stay home:** Do NOT leave to "get supplies" (you'll be too late)
2. **Secure water:** Fill every container immediately (before pipes empty)
3. **Inventory supplies:** Know exactly what you have
4. **Family accountability:** Ensure everyone is home and safe
5. **Security posture:** Lock doors, close curtains, low profile
6. **Radio check:** Try AM/FM radio (some stations may survive)
7. **Assess EMP damage:** Test critical electronics (flashlight, radio)

## Faraday Protection (CRITICAL for EMP)

### What to Protect
Store duplicates of critical electronics in Faraday cages:
- **Communication:** Ham radio, FRS radios, AM/FM radio
- **Power:** Solar charge controllers, battery management systems
- **Light:** LED headlamps, flashlights (have spares)
- **Information:** USB drives with survival manuals, maps
- **Entertainment:** MP3 players with music/audiobooks (morale)
- **Medical:** Digital thermometers, blood pressure monitors

### DIY Faraday Protection
**Simple method:**
1. Metal trash can with tight-fitting lid
2. Line with cardboard (insulation from metal)
3. Wrap items in plastic, then aluminum foil
4. Place in can, seal lid
5. Store in basement/interior (additional shielding)

**Materials needed for {{family_size}} people:**
- 2-3 metal trash cans (20-30 gallon)
- Heavy-duty aluminum foil (4-5 rolls)
- Cardboard pieces for insulation
- Plastic bags for moisture protection

## Supply Priorities for Grid Down

### Phase 1: Survival (Weeks 1-4)

**Water (MOST CRITICAL):**
- Storage: {{water_month_1}} gallons (1 gal/person/day × {{family_size}} × 30 days)
- Purification: 3+ methods (boiling, filter, chemical tablets)
- Sources: Identify local sources (streams, ponds, wells)
- Collection: Rain catchment system, tarps, containers

**Food (No Refrigeration):**
- {{calories_per_day}} calories per person per day
- Shelf-stable: Rice, beans, canned goods, MREs
- Emphasis on calorie-dense: Fats, oils, nuts, peanut butter
- Cooking: Camp stove, propane, wood (no microwave/electric)
- Preservation: Salt, sugar, vinegar for extending fresh food

**Security:**
- Home defense: [Appropriate to user's situation and legality]
- Reinforced entry points: Deadbolts, door jammers, window locks
- Perimeter awareness: Outdoor lighting (solar), noise alerts
- Low profile: Blackout curtains, quiet operations, no obvious wealth

**Light and Heat:**
- Flashlights: LED, many spare batteries
- Candles: 50+ for months of evening light
- Heating: Alternative heat source (wood stove, propane heater)
- Insulation: Heavy blankets, plastic sheeting for windows
- Ventilation: Carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting

### Phase 2: Adaptation (Months 2-6)

**Extended Food Supply:**
- Bulk staples: 50 lb bags of rice, beans, flour, oats
- Sprouting seeds: Fresh nutrition without growing season
- Vitamins: Multivitamins for nutritional gaps
- Comfort foods: Coffee, tea, chocolate, spices (morale)
- Barter goods: Extra food, alcohol, tobacco for trade

**Skills Development:**
- Food preservation: Canning, smoking, drying
- Gardening: Start growing food immediately
- Hunting/fishing: If legal and possible in your area
- Water collection: Advanced filtration, well drilling
- Repair skills: Mechanical, electrical, plumbing basics

**Community:**
- Neighbor assessment: Who can you trust and trade with?
- Skill sharing: What can you offer? What do you need?
- Security cooperation: Neighborhood watch, mutual defense
- Resource pooling: Combine resources for efficiency
- Information sharing: Radio networks, message relays

### Phase 3: Sustainability (6+ Months)

**Self-Sufficiency:**
- Food production: Garden fully operational, preserving harvest
- Seed saving: Heirloom seeds for next season
- Livestock: Chickens, rabbits (if space allows)
- Energy: Solar panels (protected in Faraday), micro-hydro
- Water: Permanent source (well, spring, consistent source)

**Medical:**
- First aid: Advanced trauma training and supplies
- Antibiotics: Fish antibiotics (controversial, research carefully)
- Dental: Basic dental care kit, oil of cloves
- Chronic conditions: 6-12 month medication stockpile
- Herbal medicine: Learn medicinal plants for your region

**Trade Economy:**
- Valuable goods: Alcohol, tobacco, ammunition, medicine
- Skills: Medical, mechanical, electrical, carpentry
- Tools: Extra hand tools for trade
- Luxury items: Coffee, chocolate, spices, toiletries
- Information: Books, manuals, maps, seeds
