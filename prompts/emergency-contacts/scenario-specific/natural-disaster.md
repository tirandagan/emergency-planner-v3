# Natural Disaster Scenario - Emergency Contacts

## Scenario-Specific Priorities

For natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires):

### Critical Contacts
1. **911** - Immediate emergency response
2. **Local Hospitals** - Trauma care, especially Level 1/2 trauma centers
3. **Poison Control** - Chemical exposures from damaged infrastructure
4. **State Emergency Management** - Shelter locations, evacuation orders
5. **Local Fire Department** - Rescue operations, hazmat response

### Important Contacts
6. **FEMA Hotline** - Federal disaster assistance and resources
7. **American Red Cross** - Emergency shelters and disaster relief
8. **Local Police** - Security, traffic control, evacuation assistance
9. **Pharmacies** - Medication access (especially 24-hour locations)
10. **Utility Companies** - Power, water, gas service updates

### Community Resources
11. **Local Emergency Management Office** - Community-specific information
12. **Community Centers** - Shelter locations, resource distribution
13. **Public Libraries** - Information access, charging stations, cooling/warming centers

## Meeting Location Considerations

For natural disasters, meeting locations should:
- Be on higher ground (flood risk areas)
- Away from fault lines (earthquake zones)
- Not in wildfire-prone vegetation
- Structurally sound buildings or open spaces
- Multiple evacuation route access
- Not near coast (hurricane zones)

## Special Considerations

- **Earthquake**: Prioritize trauma centers, structural engineers hotline
- **Hurricane**: Prioritize evacuation routes, shelters, flood zones
- **Tornado**: Prioritize underground shelters, storm shelters
- **Wildfire**: Prioritize air quality monitoring, evacuation zones
- **Flood**: Prioritize high ground locations, water rescue services
